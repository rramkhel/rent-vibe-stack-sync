        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Renters scroll through 200 identical listings. "Granite countertops." "Walking distance to transit."
          Everyone filters by beds, baths, and price—but those 200 "matching" listings all look the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dirty secret: renters don't know what they want until they feel it. Current rental search
          is optimized for inventory, not intent. The listings that actually convert? They match how
          someone wants to live, not just what they can technically afford.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="vision-section">
        <h2>The Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          What if we skipped the 47 dropdown menus and asked 5 weird questions instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          RentVibes matches renters to listings based on personality and lifestyle, then explains
          <em>why</em> each listing fits. No square footage. No parking filters. Just vibes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bet: "vibe explanations" create emotional connection. Emotional connection drives engagement.
          Engagement drives leads.

        <h2>What We're Testing</h2>
        <ul class="vision-list">
          <li>Do "vibe explanations" increase time-on-listing?</li>
          <li>Can personality questions predict which listings get leads?</li>
          <li>Will renters trust a search that doesn't ask about bathrooms?</li>
        </ul>

          This is us trying something new.
